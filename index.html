      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Machine learning is a powerful branch of artificial intelligence that
        focuses on creating systems capable of learning and adapting from data.
        Unlike traditional programming, where rules and instructions are
        explicitly coded, machine learning uses algorithms to analyze vast
        amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions
        with minimal human intervention. It plays a vital role in various
        industries, including healthcare, where it helps in diagnosing diseases
        and personalizing treatments; finance, where it detects fraudulent
        transactions and optimizes investments; and technology, where it powers
        advancements in natural language processing, computer vision, and
        autonomous systems. The process typically involves feeding data into
        models, training them to recognize patterns, and testing their accuracy
        to ensure they can generalize well to new situations. As the
        availability of data and computational power grows, machine learning
        continues to drive innovation, offering solutions to complex problems
        and reshaping the way we interact with technology and the world around
        us

      <h3>Basics of Machine Learning</h3>

      <p><b>What is Machine Learning?</b><br/>
        Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that
        focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve their
        performance without explicit programming. There are three main types of
        machine learning:

        <section>
            <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Involves learning from labeled datasets where the output (label) is known.</li>
                <li>The goal is to map inputs to outputs, e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Works with unlabeled data to identify patterns or structures within the data.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Involves an agent interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time.</li>
                <li>Used in applications like robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.</li>
            </ul>
